== Introduction

Mod Plates is a apache module that downloads for approach plates in PDF format from http://www.naco.faa.gov/, rotates and scales them, and then outputs them in a combined PDF for easier printing and viewing.

== Installation

Install apache 2.2 headers, libxml2, libapreq2, libaprutil1, libpoppler, libcairo2, libcurl, boost ver1.4 c++ headers, and cmake

For Debian / Ubuntu that equals out to:

sudo apt-get install cmake libxml2-dev libapreq2-dev libaprutil1-dev libpoppler-glib-dev libcairo2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libboost1.40-all-dev

Of cource, you'll also need at least make and g++, but you probably already have them.

In a directory where you want to build the source type cmake <path to source>

after cmake (hopefully) finds the pre-requisites, type make to compile

As far as I know, this has yet to be built by anyone else.  Therefore it very probably has hidden dependancies on something on my system.  If you encounter problems let me know and I'll attempt to help you.
